# Comment: Interactive recommender systems: A survey of the state of the art and future research challenges and opportunities

<p align="justify">
    The paper is about the human-recommender interaction, the state of art and it is presented an interactive visualization framework. The work revolves around the following topics: transparency, justification, controllability, diversity, cold start, and context. Each has its problems and different solution approaches.

    Normally, computer systems hide their logic and abstract it from the user. This simplifies things for the user and normally minimizes user errors. The idea presented is the opposite and tries to unveil the black-box. The idea of recommender systems is really simple, where the user rates and/or interacts with items that later on are recommended based on those interactions. This is not enough, the recommender systems are much more complex and the users question the systems. Therefore, a solution is to get the user more involved and show them graphically, on a high level, the system's functionality. By giving the user more "power", it feels better with the system and understands on a certain level the recommendations, minimizing trust issues.

    Another idea that caught my attention is that "related work shows that recommendations should maintain a certain level of diversity, even if it sacrifices overall accuracy". This is counterintuitive but makes sense. The recommender systems always depend on the problem it is being used, but novelty is always desirable and important to achieve.

    Concluding, recommender systems are not a common computer science problem that needs the users' interaction on different levels. In the paper, it is presented an interactive visualization framework of recommender systems and there is an analysis of existing recommender systems revolving around ideas such as transparency, justification, diversity, and context.
