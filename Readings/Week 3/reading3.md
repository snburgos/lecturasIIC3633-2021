# Comment: Evaluating Recommendation Systems

<p align="justify">
  The paper is about how to evaluate recommendation systems. Although there are many ways to evaluate algorithms of this nature, such as the accuracy obtained, on recommendation systems are other characteristics involved. For example, the trajectory the user has as a timestamp of the consumptions. The content revolves around three main experiments: offline, user studies and onlines experiments. The three have pros and cons, mainly involving a trade-off between reliability and accesibilty and/or ease to conduct the experiment.

  The authors present a numerous number of topics (mainly in section 2) without going on depth. I think it would be better to focus on some topics and explain them well than just present some and do not explaining them good enough. That is because most of those topics are known for the reader, as the things said are common sense or in some way obvious (as there is lack of details). Anyway, these topics are almost always accompanied with good examples and references, even an invitation, to read other papers about that theme. This reflects the knowledge of the authors and as the paper is not mainly about those topics, they prefer to just introduce them and give the option to learn more.

  The objective of the paper is "how recommendation algorithms could be evaluated in order to select the best algorithm from a set of candidates" (section 4). As it is said, it concentrates on selecting only one algorithm or comparing algorithm A v/s algorithm B to see which one is best. The authors never mention a way to evaluate if algorithm A and B might complement with each other. Probably, most of the recommendation systems are an ensemble of algorithms, therefore it is important to mention these cases. It could be that algorithm A is already an ensemble of algorithms, but still there is no better metric than trying to see if there is a complement with algorithm B. The netflix prize winners used an ensemble algorithm combining at least three technics, one of each subteam that formed the winning team. Therefore, it would be very interesting to use the evaluation methods on ways to evaluate the complementation of different algorithm.

  The paper is very complete in a way that it considers many factors involving the evaluation of the recommendation systems. It uses many equations and probability methods that gives confidence to the evaluation systems. Although some topics are not so neccessary, the authors always give the option to investigate more about those topics and see the details that they are missing on the paper. Finally, it would have been interesting to see some evaluation methods involving the ensemble of algorithms.
