# Comment: Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives

* Extensive research.
* Google Play, YouTube.

<p align="justify">
    The paper sweeps over a vast amount of recommender systems based on deep learning. It is a compilation of different techniques involving deep learning, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Autoencoder (AE), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) among others. The authors did an exhaustive research, looking for different models of the area and different applications.

    Along with the last idea, the paper has 209 references, meaning the survey must involve the best deep learning models. Furthermore, big applications/companies are mentioned, such as YouTube, Google Play and Yahoo News, for their deep learning based recommender systems. This reflects the good research the authors did and that the content of the paper is reliable and a good summary of many recommender systems. Also, the items used are from different natures. For example, text, images, audio and video. That is, there is a good amount of combinations between deep learning models and the problems' natures to look for if needed.
