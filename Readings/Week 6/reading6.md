# Comment: Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives

<p align="justify">
    The paper sweeps over a vast amount of recommender systems based on deep learning. It is a compilation of different techniques involving deep learning, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Autoencoder (AE), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) among others. The authors did exhaustive research, looking for different models of the area and different applications.

    Along with the last idea, the paper has 209 references, meaning the survey must involve the best deep learning models. Furthermore, big applications/companies are mentioned, such as YouTube, Google Play, and Yahoo News, for their deep learning-based recommender systems. This reflects the good research the authors did and that the content of the paper is reliable and a good summary of many recommender systems. Also, the items used are from different natures. For example, text, images, audio, and video. That is, there is a good amount of combinations between deep learning models and the problems' natures to look for if needed.

    I would like to comment on the impact deep learning has on recommender systems. Deep learning has proven to be one of the most useful techniques in Computer Science, being used in different and many fields. As it is mentioned, multiple neural building blocks are an advantage when dealing with content-based recommendations. As previously said, this works on different recommendation problems (e.g. text or images), where deep learning-based approaches can ingest the content end-to-end. Additionally, the deep learning models can be ensembled among them and/or with the traditional recommender system models.

    Deep learning is an area of constant growth, where the recommender systems problems might be solved. The authors of the paper surveyed numerous amount of deep learning models identifying different techniques and problem approaches. They gave advantages and disadvantages of using the deep learning techniques involved in the survey. Finally, each year new models come up and always having better recommender systems involving deep learning.
